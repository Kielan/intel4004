# intel4004
Intel 4004 Emulator - An emulator of the infamous Intel 4004.  This emulator is designed to teach the internals of a CPU and its relation to programming.  It is a fairly faithful emulation of the Intel 4004, 4001 and 4002.  The computer includes 4KB (32768 bit) ROM (4001) and 640 Byte (5120 bit) RAM (4002).

This emulator is a work in progress.  A large percentage of it is complete, including a lot of the instruction set.

Check back here over the next few weeks as I bring it up to a functional state.

Oh, I gave it an AppStore...and self-documenting code possibilities.
